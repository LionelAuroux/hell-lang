Hello,
I will be giving a presentation next Wednesday may 12th at 5pm in room 301.
subject:

Now, the compile chain is more complex than ever.
To produce a software, we could use a lot of different tools to produce intermediary code in different language.

For example, DSL, meta-programming and just-in-time compilation could be used in a same software.

We need to classify and identify all this steps in the compilation if we want to go beyond.

So we try to produce this on a set of different tools and we are ready to show you our first results.
Q&A will follow to discuss our choices.
